# Books_ISBN

App to enter books into database. Website allows ISBN entry. Node.js server queries ISBN database to retrieve book details, and inserts information into a MySQL database hosted on AWS.

Place html file in public directory.

www.tmbattey.net accesses AWS EC2 instance that hosts the app. (Note that I don't run the app 24x7 to lessen the AWS charges.)
